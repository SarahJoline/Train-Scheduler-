This is my train Scheduler app.
The user can put in the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. Then, the next train and the minutes until that train arrives will appear on the screen.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Moment.js, Firebase.

Here's the link to the deployed page:
