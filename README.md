This is my train Scheduler app.
The user can put in the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. Then, the next train and the minutes until that train arrives will appear on the screen. Firebase was used in order to store this data, so you can see all the trains that have been added.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Moment.js, Firebase.

Here's the link to the deployed page:
